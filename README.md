# Ann-Arbor-water-prediction-using-Voting-regressor

Background: In the past years, Ann Arbor's water production has seen distinct patterns correlating with environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall. The summer months, characterized by the scorching sun, have traditionally seen an uptick in water production, attributed largely to activities like lawn sprinkling. Conversely, a splash of rain tends to reduce this demand, as natural water takes over some of our daily needs.

Given this backdrop, the aim is to develop predictive models that forecast water production. By doing so, we would be contributing directly to the city's sustainable future.

Task: 
The primary objective of this competition is to predict the water production for the City of Ann Arbor for the upcoming years 2022 and 2023.  We  have the dataset detailing the daily pumped flow into the water distribution system from 2014-2021. In addition, additional data, like air temperature and rainfall patterns are also provided.
